                        <hr>
                        <p>
                           Well first of all you will have to be attending<i> Lanna International School</i> to be able to join our team! We have practise sessions every <b>Monday</b>, <b>Wednesday</b> and <b>Fridays</b>.
                           You will need yo buy a Lanna kit and attend all practise sessions if you would like to play in as much games as possible. I'd reccomend if you attend outside football clubs in order to train your football skills outside of school!
                           Make sure to stay fit and healthy and train as hard as possible! The sign up sheet is on the whiteboard next to the dome, so when football season comes around don't even hesitate and sign yourself up. You might not be able to make it to the games but you will stilll be able to 
                           go into practise sessions which is good for you because you can get some more exercise into your life! 
                    </p>
                    <h3 style="font-size: 2em">Good teams to look out for</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Our main competitors are usually Grace and Prem every year however this could change, who knows! We usually have the most challenging games with grace. They train 5days a way and their 
                        team is really organised and physical. We usually come very close to winning but they manage to finish it off in the last few minutes. If you'd like to increase our
                        chances in winning against grace make sure to do some physical training because you are going to need it!
                    </p>
                    <p>Prem are also a very good football team. Just like Grace they also can be physical at times and they sometimes depend on dirty tactics. While not as organised and Grace, Prem usually have a few players with 
                        exceptional amount of talent. So don't let your guard down when going against Prem. Also be sure to be careful for their long balls. When Prem gets desperate they won't hesitate to blast it over down into your <i>defense</i>.
                    </p>
                    <h3 style="font-size: 2em">How do we play</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The Lanna team usually uses the christmas tree formation and we put our star players near central midfield along with putting the quickest players on the wings. We focus on quick 
                        and keeping possesion.
